## Hii ðŸ‘‹

My name is KauÃª. I'm 16 years old and I really like to **develop software solutions**, specially **to make others' lives easier**. I started to study web basics (html, css, javascript, http...) 3 years ago and today I consider myself a back-end developer, although I can make some front-end stuff.

I'm focused on networking and building open source tools. Also, I write technical articles and I post them in [my blog](https://kauefraga.dev/blog/), [TabNews](https://www.tabnews.com.br/kauefraga) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/kauefraga) (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·).
