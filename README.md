## Hii ðŸ‘‹

My name is KauÃª. I'm 17 years old and I really like to **develop software solutions**, specially **to make others' lives easier**. I started to study web basics 4 years ago, and I have already worked as a back-end developer since then. Building robust back-end systems is what I'm interested in, I also have created some websites and can work on front-end too.

Check my devfolio in [kauefraga.dev/projects](https://kauefraga.dev/projects).

I'm focused on networking and building open source tools. Also, I write technical articles and I post them in [my blog](https://kauefraga.dev/blog/), [TabNews](https://www.tabnews.com.br/kauefraga) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/kauefraga) (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·).
