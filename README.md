## Hii 💜

My name is Kauê. I am 16 years old and enjoy writing code since I was 13. Very curious and self-taught, I keep seeking for the field that I belong to. I've been on the frontend, backend, game development and I liked all of them... I suppose the joy is in the computer and how it fascinates me.

This year (2024) I'm focused on networking and learning about Vuejs, Golang and PostgreSQL. I wanna produce some technical articles (🇧🇷) over the year and share them at [TabNews](http://tabnews.com.br/kauefraga) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/kauefraga).

#### 🤹‍♂️ Some of my hobbies are:

- Automating random stuff
- Drawing things (pencil/eraser and digitally)
- Playing videogames (Fortnite, Rocket League, Phasmophobia, Osu, Warframe and recently Necesse)
- Listening to music
- Practicing volleyball
