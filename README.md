## Hii ðŸ’œ

My name is KauÃª. I am 16 years old and enjoy writing code since I was 13. Very curious and self-taught, I keep seeking for the field that I belong to. I've been on the frontend, backend, game development and I liked all of them... I suppose the joy is in the computer and how it fascinates me.

This year (2024) I'm focused on networking and learning about Vuejs, Golang and PostgreSQL. I wanna produce some technical articles (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·) over the year and share them at TabNews and Twitter/X.

My hobbies are:

- Automating random stuff
- Drawing (pencil/eraser and digitally)
- Playing videogames (Fortnite, Rocket League, Phasmophobia, Osu, Warframe and recently Necesse)
- Listening to music
- Practice volleyball

What I made:

- kauefraga.tech
- kauefraga.art
- Ping Pong
- Learning repositories
- Commission Tracker
- Anime Archive

Finally, you can reach me at:

- Discord
- Linkedin
- Email
