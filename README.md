## Hiii 👋

My name is Kauê. I'm 16 years old and I really like to develop software solutions, specially to make others' lives easier. I started to study web basics (html, css, javascript, http...) 3 years ago and today I consider myself a back-end developer, although I can make some front-end stuff.

This year (2024) I'm focused on networking and learning more about React, Go and PostgreSQL. Also, I wanna write some technical articles (🇧🇷) over the year and share them at [my blog](https://kauefraga.dev/blog/), [TabNews](https://www.tabnews.com.br/kauefraga) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/kauefraga).
