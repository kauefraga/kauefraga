## Hiii 👋

My name is Kauê. I'm 16 years old and I really like to develop software solutions, specially to make others' lives easier. I started to study web basics (html, css, javascript, http...) 3 years ago and today I consider myself a back-end developer, although I can make some front-end stuff.

I'm focused on networking and learning more about React, Go and PostgreSQL. Also, I write technical articles and I post them in [my blog](https://kauefraga.dev/blog/), [TabNews](https://www.tabnews.com.br/kauefraga) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/kauefraga) (🇧🇷).
